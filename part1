I made sure that my local machine has PHP and Composer installed.
I created a new Laravel project via the Composer create-project command: composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel example-app
I verified that Laravel is installed and working correctly by creating a new Laravel project and running the development server. To do this, I ran the command: php artisan serve in the root of my project directory. This command started a local development server at http://localhost:8000.
I took a screenshot of the running server.
